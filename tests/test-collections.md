We are trying to test the MCP global search function. 

Do not review any files on the local file system, only use the tools you've been provided.

 I'd like you to look up the available indexes from the available mcp servers, do some searching, and output to ./tests/output/test-collecitons.md.

Tell me about the tools and collections available

I'd like you to tell me about the collections as well, and what you know about them. Do they have a description?
